<h1>CONDUCTING A SECURITY AUDIT.</h1>

<h2>PROJECT OBJECTIVES</h2>

- <b>To build preactical knowledge of the security auditing process,</b>
- <b>To carry out risk assessment,</b>
- <b>To carry out controls and compliance assesment,</b>
- <b>To be able to provide recommendations for security lapses.</b>

<h2>SCENARIO</h2>

XYZ production company is a small business that develops and sells kitchenware. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, the company's online presence has grown recently, attracting customers from around the world. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. NOTE: This scenario is based on a fictional company. Scenario template from Google. 

<h2>XYZ Production Company: Scope(current assets), goals and risk assessment report.</h2>

<h3>Scope of the audit</h3>
The scope covered all the assets, alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices within the company. The assets managed by the IT department included;

- <b>On-premises equipment for in-office business needs,</b>
- <b>Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc,</b>
- <b>Storefront products available for retail sale on site and online; stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse,</b>
- <b>Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management,</b>
- <b>Internet access,</b>
- <b>Internal network,</b>
- <b>Data retention and storage,</b>
- <b>Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring.</b>

<h3>Goals of the audit</h3>

The goal of this audit was to assess all existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices needed to be implemented to improve XYZ production company's security posture.

<h3>RISK ASSESSMENT</h3>

<h4>Risk Description</h4>

There was an inadequate management of assets. Additionally, the company did not have all of the proper controls in place, making it uncompliant to an extent with the national and international regulations and standards.

<h4>Control best practices</h4>

XYZ Production Company would need to dedicate resources to identify all assets present so as to appropriately manage them. Additionally, they would need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

<h4>Risk score</h4>

The risk score was 8, on a scale of 1-10. This was due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.
  
<h4>Additional comments</h4>

The potential impact from the loss of an asset was rated as medium, because the IT department did not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies was also high because Botium Toys did not have all of the necessary controls in place and was not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure. Review the following bullet points for specific details:

- <b>All Botium Toys employees had access to internally stored data and may have been able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII.</b>
- <b>Encryption was not used to ensure confidentiality of customers’ credit card information that was accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in the company’s internal database.</b>
- <b>Access controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties had not been implemented.</b>
- <b>The IT department had ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure data integrity.</b>
- <b>The IT department had a firewall that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.</b>
- <b>Antivirus software was installed and monitored regularly by the IT department.</b>
- <b>The IT department had not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS).</b>
- <b>There were no disaster recovery plans currently in place, and the company did not have backups of critical data.</b>
- <b>•The IT department had established a plan to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours if there was a security breach. Additionally, privacy policies, procedures, and processes had been developed and were enforced among IT department members/other employees, to properly document and maintain data.</b>
- <b>Although a password policy existed, its requirements were nominal and not in line with current minimum password complexity requirements.</b>
- <b>There was no centralized password management system that enforced the password policy’s minimum requirements, which sometimes affected productivity when employees/vendors submitted a ticket to the IT department to recover or reset a password.</b>
- <b>While legacy systems were monitored and maintained, there was no regular schedule in place for these tasks and intervention methods were unclear.</b>
- <b>The store’s physical location, which includes XYZ production company's main offices, store front, and warehouse of products, had sufficient locks, up-to-date closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance, as well as functioning fire detection and prevention systems.</b>

<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>

Multiple controls will need to be implemented to improve XYZ's security posture and better ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information, including: Least Privilege, disaster recovery plans, password policies, separation of duties, an IDS, ongoing legacy system management, encryption, and a password management system.

To address gaps in compliance, XYZ will need to implement controls such as Least Privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. The company will also need to properly classify assets, to identify additional controls that may need to be implemented to improve their security posture and better protect sensitive information.
